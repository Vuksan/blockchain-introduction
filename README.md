Blockchain and python (2.7)

## miner.py
This is a **simplified** miner written in python.

## sendtx.py
This script is used to present how easily you can make a transaction on the blockchain.
However in order for this to work you will need Gamecredits client synced and running in the background.
You can clone it from [here](https://github.com/gamecredits-project/GameCredits).

*Note:* Gamecredits client syncing can take a couple of hours.

In order to test it (with fake Gamecredits) you should start the client in regtest mode:
```
{your_location}/gamecredits/src/gamecreditsd -regtest -conf={your_location}/.gamecredits/gamecredits.conf -datadir={your_location}/.gamecredits
```
